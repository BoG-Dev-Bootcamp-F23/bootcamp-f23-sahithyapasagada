          <h1>EVERY FOOD IS A SANDWICH</h1>
          <p>All food can be classified as either a sandwich or salad. A traditional sandwich typically consists of some form of filling (such as meat, cheese, vegetables) 
            placed between two slices of bread or in a roll. However, the concept of a "sandwich" can be broadened to include any dish where ingredients are enclosed 
            or layered between other items. For example, a burrito with its fillings wrapped in a tortilla or a sushi roll with rice, fish, and vegetables wrapped in 
            seaweed can be seen as variations of sandwiches. Bread only needs to support the rest of the dish in some way; it is not restricted to two opposite sides.</p>

        <div class="box2"> 
          <h1>EVERY FOOD IS A SALAD</h1>
          <p>A traditional salad often consists of a mixture of vegetables, sometimes with added proteins or other ingredients, dressed with a sauce or dressing. 
            The concept of a "salad" can also be extended to include dishes that involve mixing various ingredients together, whether cold or hot. For instance, pasta salad,
             fruit salad, or even a warm quinoa bowl with vegetables and proteins can all be seen as variations of salads. A salad must be a mixture of foods such that a typical person would not notice a difference 
             if the relative position and orientation of its ingredients were randomized</p>

        <div class="box3">   
          <h1>EXAMPLES OF ALL FOOD BEING SANDWICHES OR SALADS</h1>
          <p>Here are some examples. Ice cream with a cone, in its entirety is a sandwich. But in a bowl or right out of the container, 
            it is a salad because it exists without its own structure. A bowl of skittles is a dry salad. Sushi is a sandwich because of the rice and nori, it is the “bread.”
            Chicken soup is obviously a salad. A food where its own structure supports itself without the need of something that is not itself— let us say a bowl or a kebab stick, is a sandwich.
            Cake can just stand there without spilling out or making a mess so it is a sandwich regardless of layers.
